📋 Chief Complaint:
Severe pain and complete inability to abduct the right shoulder following a fall on an outstretched hand, accompanied by tingling in the right hand.

🩺 History of Present Illness:
Mrs. Sarah Thompson, known for well-controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, slipped at home on a wet floor and fell directly onto her outstretched right arm. She presented to the ER with acute, unrelenting right shoulder pain (rated 8/10), significant swelling, and a markedly reduced range of motion, particularly abduction. Physical examination revealed ecchymosis over the deltoid and tenderness to palpation over the greater tuberosity. Distal pulses were palpable, but a diminished sensation was noted in the median nerve distribution of the right hand. X-ray confirmed no fracture but showed significant joint space narrowing. MRI revealed a complete full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon, severe right shoulder joint effusion, and impingement of the brachial plexus.

🧪 Lab Results (Select):
Glucose: 145 mg/dL (on admission)
HbA1c: 6.8%

🧾 Diagnosis at Discharge:
1.  Full-thickness rotator cuff tear, right supraspinatus tendon, traumatic
2.  Right shoulder joint effusion, severe
3.  Brachial plexopathy, traumatic, right upper extremity (secondary to fall)
4.  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, well-controlled

🔧 Procedures Performed:
1.  Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of the right shoulder with suture anchor fixation
2.  Extensive subacromial decompression and bursectomy
3.  Synovectomy of the glenohumeral joint
4.  Nerve block, interscalene (for post-operative pain management)

💉 Modifiers Context (Implied):
* Procedure on right side
* Involvement of assistant surgeon (MD)
* Increased complexity due to significant joint effusion, pre-existing degenerative changes, and nerve impingement
* Separate procedure performed (e.g., nerve block)

🏨 Hospital Course:
Patient underwent arthroscopic repair under general anesthesia without immediate complications. Post-operatively, patient experienced transient but moderate right arm paresthesia, managed conservatively. Nerve block provided excellent pain control. Blood glucose levels were closely monitored and managed. Passive physiotherapy commenced on day 2 post-op, with emphasis on gentle range of motion. Discharged stable with pain well-controlled.

💊 Medications on Discharge:
* Oxycodone 5 mg PO q6h PRN for pain (Max 20mg/day)
* Acetaminophen 500 mg PO q8h PRN for pain
* Cefuroxime 500 mg PO BID for 5 days (post-op prophylaxis)
* Omeprazole 20 mg PO daily
* Metformin 1000 mg PO BID (for diabetes management)

📆 Follow-up:
* Orthopedic surgeon review in 7 days
* Neurology consultation in 2 weeks for brachial plexopathy follow-up
* Physical therapy sessions 3x/week for 8 weeks
* Primary Care Physician (PCP) follow-up in 1 month for diabetes management and general health.
